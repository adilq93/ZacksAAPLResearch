"The  reason  for  the  analyst  over-rides  is  that  there  are  often  factors  such  as  valuation,  industry  conditions  and management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model. Zacks Rank The Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reﬂects trends in earnings estimate revisions. ",75
"Zacks Style Scores The Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way to focus on the highest rated stocks that best ﬁt their own stock picking preferences. Academic  research  has  proven  that  stocks  with  the  best  Value,  Growth  and  Momentum  characteristics outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns a rating  of  A,  B,  C,  D  and  F.  We  also  produce  the  VGM  Score  (V  for  Value,  G  for  Growth  and  M  for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. ",105
"This is perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board. Value Score  Growth Score  Momentum Score  VGM Score  DD  AA  FF  CC  As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B. ",66
